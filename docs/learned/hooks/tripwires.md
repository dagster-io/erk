# Hooks Tripwires

Action-triggered rules for this category. Consult BEFORE taking any matching action.

**CRITICAL: Before creating a PreToolUse hook** → Read [PreToolUse Hook Implementation Guide](pretooluse-implementation.md) first. Test against edge cases. Untested hooks fail silently (exit 0, no output). Read docs/learned/testing/hook-testing.md first.
