# Configuration Tripwires

Action-triggered rules for this category. Consult BEFORE taking any matching action.

**CRITICAL: Before adding a new config option without defining it in a Pydantic schema** → Read [Schema-Driven Config System](schema-driven-config.md) first. All config keys must be defined in schema.py with proper ConfigLevel. The schema is the single source of truth for field names, descriptions, and validation.
