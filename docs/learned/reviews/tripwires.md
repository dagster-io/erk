# Reviews Tripwires

Action-triggered rules for this category. Consult BEFORE taking any matching action.

**CRITICAL: Before flagging code as untested in PR review** → Read [Test Coverage Review Agent](test-coverage-agent.md) first. Check if file is legitimately untestable first. CLI wrappers (only Click decorators), type-only files (TypeVar/Protocol/type aliases), and ABC interfaces (only abstract methods) should be excluded from test coverage requirements.
