# Auto-Generated File Audit Protocol

## Detection

Files with `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY -->` are generated by `erk docs sync` from source documents.

## STAMP ONLY Approach

For auto-generated files:

1. **Add audit metadata** to frontmatter (will be overwritten, but creates audit trail)
2. **Do NOT edit content** - changes will be lost on next `erk docs sync`
3. **Focus verification on source docs** that feed the generation
4. **Verify generation is working** by checking output matches source

## Common Auto-Generated Files

- `docs/learned/*/tripwires.md` - generated from frontmatter in category docs
- `docs/learned/index.md` - generated from all category indexes

## After Auditing

Run `erk docs sync` to regenerate auto-generated files with any source changes.
