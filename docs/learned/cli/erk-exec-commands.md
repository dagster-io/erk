# erk exec Commands

The `erk exec` command group contains utility scripts for automation and agent workflows.

## Usage Pattern

All erk exec commands use named options (not positional arguments for most parameters):

```bash
# Correct
erk exec get-pr-review-comments --pr 123

# Wrong - positional arguments don't work
erk exec get-pr-review-comments 123
```
