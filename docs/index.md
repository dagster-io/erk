# Erk Documentation

Erk is a CLI tool for plan-oriented agentic engineering: a workflow where AI agents create implementation plans, execute them in isolated worktrees, and ship code via automated PR workflows.

## Getting Started

Coming soon.

## Features

- **Plan-First Workflow**: AI agents create detailed implementation plans before writing code
- **Worktree Isolation**: Each implementation runs in its own isolated git worktree
- **Agent-Driven Development**: Automated PR workflows powered by Claude Code
- **Documentation as Code**: Agent-generated documentation lives alongside the codebase
