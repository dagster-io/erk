## Branch Naming Convention

**Format:** `PPPP-DESC-MM-DD-HHMM`

**Example:** `1904-gt-pr-prep-prepare-branch-12-02-0106`

**Components:**

- `PPPP` - Plan/issue number for quick reference
- `DESC` - Shorthand description so you don't have to memorize numbers
- `MM-DD-HHMM` - Timestamp for uniqueness on each queue submission

**Rationale:**

- Minute-level granularity is sufficient; collisions are rare in practice
- If collision occurs, a number suffix is added automatically
