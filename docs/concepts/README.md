# Concepts

Core ideas that power erk's plan-oriented workflow.

## Foundation

- **[Worktrees](worktrees.md)** - Git worktrees enable parallel development without branch switching
- **[Stacked PRs](stacked-prs.md)** - Graphite's approach to incremental, reviewable changes
- **[Plan Mode](plan-mode.md)** - Claude Code's planning workflow and how erk extends it

## The Big Picture

- **[The Workflow](the-workflow.md)** - The complete journey from idea to merged PR
- **[Plan-Oriented Engineering](plan-oriented-engineering.md)** - Why planning first leads to better outcomes
