There is no branch restoration in the current implementation.\n\nSource: `packages/erk-shared/src/erk_shared/gateway/branch_manager/graphite.py` (GraphiteBranchManager.create_branch, line 69-106)\n\nNote: The existing drift-risk comment on this line suggests fixing to \"the branch manager restores the original branch after tracking\" \u2014 but this phrasing is itself inaccurate. The correct phrasing is: \"After branch creation, the branch is not automatically checked out, so an explicit checkout call is required.\"\n\nSuggested fix: Replace line 142 with: \"**Important:** After `create_branch()`, explicit `checkout_branch()` is called because branch creation does not automatically check out the new branch.\"",
