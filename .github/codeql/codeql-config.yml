# Suppress specific queries that have been manually mitigated
query-filters:
  # The autofix.yml workflow has fork protection (lines 45-52) that prevents
  # untrusted code execution. CodeQL's static analysis cannot see this runtime check.
  - exclude:
      id: actions/untrusted-checkout/critical
      # This exclusion is safe because:
      # 1. Fork PRs are blocked before checkout (head_repo != base_repo check)
      # 2. Only same-repo PRs can trigger code execution
      # 3. The workflow is only useful for same-repo PRs anyway (can't push to forks)
