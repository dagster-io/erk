# TODO

## Important growth features

- Nudges / growth. Use case based
  - VC-specific
  - SaaS/sales/gtm
  - Generic

## Commercialization / scaling

- Self serve onboarding flow, including creating repos, DWH secrets etc.
- Move off of my personal access token

## Important quality work

- Better way to onboard new datasets. Current admin command is very janky
- Ability to update context PRs by replying to them in slack
- Regular data docs refreshes that don't depend on dagster

## Other ideas

- More aggressive thread muting (first @reply mutes the thread until compass is mentioned again)
- Custom MCP server support in a self serve way

## Less important

- Ability to create and update spreadsheets and ipynb
- Generalize Dagster catalog import to support other platforms
- collapse the conversation history, provide a webapp link to the full trace
