topic: self serve paying customers definition
incorrect_understanding:
  When counting self-serve paying customers, I should look
  at customers who have had any invoices in the last 2+ months to capture active customers
correct_understanding:
  When counting current self-serve paying customers, I should
  look at customers who had paying invoices (invoice_total > 0) in the most recent
  month based on invoice_created_at. This gives the accurate current count (e.g.,
  636 customers in August 2025) rather than including potentially churned customers
  from a broader time window
