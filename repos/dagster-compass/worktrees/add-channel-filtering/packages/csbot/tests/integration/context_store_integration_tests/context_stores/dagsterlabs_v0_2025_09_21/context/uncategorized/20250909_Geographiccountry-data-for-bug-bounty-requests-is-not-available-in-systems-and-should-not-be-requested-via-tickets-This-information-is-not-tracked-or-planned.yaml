topic: geographic data for bug bounty requests
incorrect_understanding:
  I should open data request tickets when geographic/country
  information isn't available for bug bounty or support requests
correct_understanding:
  Geographic/country data for bug bounty requests is not available
  and should not be requested via tickets. This information is not captured in our
  systems and is not something we plan to track.
