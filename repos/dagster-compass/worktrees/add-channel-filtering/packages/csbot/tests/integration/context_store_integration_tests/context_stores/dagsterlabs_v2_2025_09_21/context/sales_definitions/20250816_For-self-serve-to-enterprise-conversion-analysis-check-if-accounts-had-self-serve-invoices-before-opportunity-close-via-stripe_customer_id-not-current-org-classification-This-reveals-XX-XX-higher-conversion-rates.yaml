topic: self-serve to enterprise conversion analysis methodology
incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing self-serve to enterprise conversions, I should
  look at the organization's self_serve_or_enterprise field or current plan type to
  determine if they were originally self-serve
correct_understanding:
  "When analyzing self-serve to enterprise conversions, I should\
  \ check if accounts had at least one self-serve invoice before their opportunity\
  \ closed won. Link opportunities \u2192 accounts \u2192 self-serve invoices via\
  \ stripe_customer_id, and check if MIN(invoice_created_at) < opportunity close_date.\
  \ The organization classification shows current state, not historical journey. This\
  \ methodology reveals much higher conversion rates (30-50%) compared to just looking\
  \ at current org classification."
