topic: ARR velocity analysis methodology
incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing ARR velocity by quarter, I should show total
  ARR velocity as one of the key metrics
correct_understanding:
  Total ARR velocity is a meaningless metric when analyzing quarterly
  trends. The meaningful metrics are average and median ARR velocity, as these show
  the actual velocity performance per deal rather than just aggregating velocity values.
