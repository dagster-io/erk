topic: champions vs intro meeting contacts
incorrect_understanding:
  I initially looked at contacts with "champion" in their job
  title when asked about champion job titles
correct_understanding:
  The user was asking about intro meeting contacts, not contacts
  with "champion" in their title. Champions refers to contacts who have intro meetings
  scheduled.
