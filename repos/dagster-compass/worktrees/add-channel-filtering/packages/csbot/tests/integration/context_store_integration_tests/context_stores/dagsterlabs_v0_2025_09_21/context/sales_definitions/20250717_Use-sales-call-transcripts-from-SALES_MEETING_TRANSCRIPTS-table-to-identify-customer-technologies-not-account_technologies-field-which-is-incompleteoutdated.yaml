incorrect_understanding:
  When identifying what technologies or integrations customers
  use, I should rely on the account_technologies field in the accounts table as the
  primary source
correct_understanding:
  When identifying what technologies or integrations customers
  use, I should search sales call transcripts in the SALES_MEETING_TRANSCRIPTS table
  rather than relying on the account_technologies field, which is incomplete and outdated.
  The transcripts contain real discussions about customer tech stacks, integrations,
  and technology mentions that provide much more comprehensive and current information.
