topic: quarterly date ranges for 2025
incorrect_understanding:
  I used Q3 2025 as starting july 1st, when it actually starts
  august 1st
correct_understanding:
  Q3 2025 should be august 1st through october 31st, 2025. Since
  we're currently in august, this should be analyzed as "Q3 2025 YTD" or "partial
  Q3 2025" through the current date, but I should be clear about the timeframe and
  what constitutes each quarter
