topic: risk weighted forecast calculation
incorrect_understanding:
  When calculating realistic forecast, I should only include
  closed deals plus commit stage deals, excluding best case weighted values
correct_understanding:
  When calculating risk-weighted forecast, I should include ALL
  pipeline stages multiplied by their respective probabilities - closed (100%) + commit
  (80%) + best case (mix of 80%/50%/20%) + pipeline (5%). The realistic forecast should
  be the sum of all risk-weighted values across all active pipeline stages.
