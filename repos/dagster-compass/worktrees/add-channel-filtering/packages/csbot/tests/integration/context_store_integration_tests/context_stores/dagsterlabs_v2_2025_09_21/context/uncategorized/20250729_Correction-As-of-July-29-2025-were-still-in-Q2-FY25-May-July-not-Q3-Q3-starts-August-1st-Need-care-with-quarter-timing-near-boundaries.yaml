topic: current quarter determination
incorrect_understanding:
  I incorrectly stated in an earlier thread that we were in
  Q3 already
correct_understanding:
  As of July 29, 2025, we are still in Q2 FY25. Q2 runs May-July,
  and Q3 doesn't start until August 1st. Need to be more careful about quarter timing
  when the current date is near quarter boundaries.
