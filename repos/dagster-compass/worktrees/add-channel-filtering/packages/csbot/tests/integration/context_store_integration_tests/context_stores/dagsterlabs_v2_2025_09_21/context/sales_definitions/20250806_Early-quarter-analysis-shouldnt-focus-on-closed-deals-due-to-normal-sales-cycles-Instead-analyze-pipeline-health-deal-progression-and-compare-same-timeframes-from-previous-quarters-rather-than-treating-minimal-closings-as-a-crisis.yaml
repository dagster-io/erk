topic: early quarter performance analysis methodology
incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing early quarter performance (6 days into Q3),
  I treated closed deal metrics as indicative of quarterly performance and called
  it a crisis
correct_understanding:
  Early quarter periods (first few days/week) rarely have significant
  deal closings due to normal sales cycle patterns. Analysis should focus on pipeline
  health, deal progression, and compare same timeframes from previous quarters rather
  than treating minimal closed deal activity as a performance crisis
