topic: scheduled analysis tone and language
incorrect_understanding:
  For scheduled analyses, I should use subjective language
  like "critical," "urgent," "immediate intervention needed" and make priority assessments
  and recommendations
correct_understanding:
  For scheduled analyses, I should maintain objective, even-keeled
  language without subjective priority assessments. Report findings factually without
  characterizing urgency or criticality, as I'm not in a position to assess business
  priorities
