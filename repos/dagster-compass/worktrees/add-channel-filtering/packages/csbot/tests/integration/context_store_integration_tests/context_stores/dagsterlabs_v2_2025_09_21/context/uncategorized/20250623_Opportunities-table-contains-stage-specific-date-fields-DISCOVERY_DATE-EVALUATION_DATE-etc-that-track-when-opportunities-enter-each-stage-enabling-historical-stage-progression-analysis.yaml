topic: opportunities table stage date fields
incorrect_understanding:
  The opportunities table only shows current stage and doesn't
  have historical stage change tracking, so I cannot determine when opportunities
  moved between specific stages
correct_understanding:
  The opportunities table has specific date fields for each stage
  (DISCOVERY_DATE, EVALUATION_DATE, PROPOSAL_DATE, NEGOTIATION_REVIEW_DATE, etc.)
  that track when opportunities moved into each stage, allowing for accurate stage
  progression analysis
