topic: Year 1 ARR by account analysis
incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing top accounts by year 1 ARR, I should sum all
  opportunities for each account to get their total year 1 ARR value
correct_understanding:
  When analyzing top accounts by year 1 ARR, I should look at
  individual opportunities rather than summing multiple deals per account, as this
  can artificially inflate values by including renewals and upsells that don't represent
  true year 1 ARR
