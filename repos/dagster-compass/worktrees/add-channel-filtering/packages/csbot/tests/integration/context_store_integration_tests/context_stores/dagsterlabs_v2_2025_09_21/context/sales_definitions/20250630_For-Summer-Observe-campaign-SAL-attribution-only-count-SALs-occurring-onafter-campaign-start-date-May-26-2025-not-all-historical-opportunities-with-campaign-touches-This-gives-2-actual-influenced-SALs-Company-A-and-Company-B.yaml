topic: Summer Observe campaign SAL attribution
incorrect_understanding:
  When looking for SALs touched by a campaign, I should include
  all historical opportunities where the campaign appears in any touch attribution
  field, regardless of when the SAL occurred relative to the campaign start date
correct_understanding:
  "When looking for SALs touched by a campaign, I should focus
  on SALs that occurred during or after the campaign period. For the Summer Observe
  campaign (started May 26, 2025), the actual SALs influenced are those with SAL dates
  on/after the campaign start date, which totals 2 SALs: Company X and Company Y"
