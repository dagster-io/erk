topic: lead source field usage
incorrect_understanding:
  I should use LEAD_SOURCE field for lead source analysis,
  and "Waitlist" is a meaningful lead source representing current signups for our
  cloud platform
correct_understanding:
  I should always use RECENT_SOURCE field instead of LEAD_SOURCE
  for lead source analysis. "Waitlist" in LEAD_SOURCE is a legacy/useless signal from
  pre-release signups in 2022 or earlier that pollutes attribution due to first-touch
  attribution with no expiration. RECENT_SOURCE provides the actual meaningful lead
  source attribution.
