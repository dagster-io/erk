topic: organization status lifecycle
incorrect_understanding:
  Assumed that READ_ONLY status meant inactive/trial users
  and that high active percentage in June represented improved conversion
correct_understanding:
  Organizations have a 14-day free trial period, so newer organizations
  (like those created in June) haven't had time to transition to READ-only status
  yet, while older organizations have completed their trials
