topic: dialpad churn status verification
incorrect_understanding:
  I included Dialpad in the active serverless enterprise accounts
  list even though they have has_active_contract = false and their contract ended
  on 2025-01-08
correct_understanding:
  When listing current enterprise accounts, I should filter by
  has_active_contract = true to exclude churned customers like Dialpad. Accounts with
  expired contracts should not be included in current customer lists even if they
  still have ARR values in the system.
