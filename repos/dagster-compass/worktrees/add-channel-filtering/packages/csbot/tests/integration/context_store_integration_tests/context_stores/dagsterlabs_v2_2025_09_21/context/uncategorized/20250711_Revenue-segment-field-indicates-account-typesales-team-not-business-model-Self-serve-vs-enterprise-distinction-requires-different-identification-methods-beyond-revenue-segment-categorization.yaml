incorrect_understanding:
  Revenue segment field (Corporate Sales vs Enterprise Sales)
  represents self-serve vs enterprise business model
correct_understanding:
  Revenue segment represents the type of account/sales team handling
  it, not the business model. Self-serve is a part of the business but should be identified
  differently, not through revenue segment field
