topic: discovery stage conversion analysis methodology
incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing discovery stage conversion rates, I should
  include all opportunities (open and closed) which creates recency bias where newer
  opportunities haven't had time to progress through the sales funnel yet, artificially
  lowering conversion rates for recent periods
correct_understanding:
  When analyzing discovery stage conversion rates, I should only
  include closed opportunities (IS_CLOSED = TRUE) to avoid recency bias. Open opportunities
  haven't reached their final outcome yet and including them severely skews the analysis,
  particularly for recent time periods where a high percentage of opportunities are
  still in progress. This provides a true historical picture of actual conversion
  performance.
