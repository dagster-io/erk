topic: win rate and loss rate analysis methodology
incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing win rates and loss rates, I should include
  all deals (open, closed won, and closed lost) which can create recency bias where
  newer deals haven't had time to close yet, artificially inflating win rates for
  recent periods
correct_understanding:
  When analyzing win rates and loss rates, I should only include
  closed deals (IS_CLOSED = TRUE) to avoid recency bias. Open deals haven't reached
  their final outcome yet and including them skews the analysis, particularly for
  recent time periods. This provides a true historical picture of actual win/loss
  performance.
