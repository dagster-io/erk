"""Token management for Compass Admin Panel - API only (legacy HTML removed)."""

# This file is kept for backwards compatibility but all HTML rendering has been removed.
# The legacy tokens_page and create_token functions are no longer needed.
# All functionality is now handled by api_routes.py with JSON APIs.
