topic: win rate analysis filtering
incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing win rates, I should include all opportunity
  types (new business + existing business) which inflates win rates due to high-converting
  renewal opportunities
correct_understanding:
  When analyzing win rates for sales performance, I should filter
  to 'New Business' opportunities only, as existing business/renewals have much higher
  win rates and skew the analysis. New business win rates are much more meaningful
  for understanding sales effectiveness.
