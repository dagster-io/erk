correct_understanding:
  When analyzing corporate vs enterprise segments, I should use
  the revenue_segment field from the accounts table, which contains "Corporate Sales"
  and "Enterprise Sales" values. Also, I should only consider opportunities that hit
  the SAL stage (have SAL_DATE populated) for meaningful win rate analysis.
