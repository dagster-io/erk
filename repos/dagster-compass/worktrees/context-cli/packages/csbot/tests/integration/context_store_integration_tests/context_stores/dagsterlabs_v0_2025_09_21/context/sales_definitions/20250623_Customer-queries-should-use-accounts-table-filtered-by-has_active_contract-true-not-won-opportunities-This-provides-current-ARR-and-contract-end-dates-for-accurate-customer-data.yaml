incorrect_understanding:
  When asked about customers, I should look at won opportunities
  from the opportunities table
correct_understanding:
  When asked about customers, I should use the accounts table
  and filter by has_active_contract = true to show only customers with currently active
  contracts. This gives current ARR and contract end dates, which is more accurate
  than looking at historical won opportunities
