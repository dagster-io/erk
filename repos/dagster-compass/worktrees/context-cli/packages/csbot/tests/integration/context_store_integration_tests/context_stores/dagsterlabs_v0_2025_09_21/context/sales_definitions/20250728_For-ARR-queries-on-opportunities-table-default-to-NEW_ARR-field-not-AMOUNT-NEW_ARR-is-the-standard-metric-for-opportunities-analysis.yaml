topic: ARR field reference in opportunities table
incorrect_understanding:
  When someone asks about ARR on the opportunities table, I
  should use the AMOUNT field or ask which ARR field they want
correct_understanding:
  When someone asks about ARR on the opportunities table, I should
  default to using the NEW_ARR field unless they specifically clarify they want a
  different field. The AMOUNT field is not used very often for opportunities analysis
  - NEW_ARR is the standard metric.
