topic: trial-to-paid conversion rate calculation methodology
incorrect_understanding:
  When calculating trial-to-paid conversion rates, I should
  include all organizations created in a period including those with ongoing free
  trials, which artificially deflates conversion rates since recent trials haven't
  had sufficient time to convert
correct_understanding:
  When calculating trial-to-paid conversion rates, I should only
  include organizations that have had sufficient time to complete their trial period
  and make a conversion decision. Recent organizations with ongoing trials should
  be excluded from conversion rate calculations as they artificially deflate the metric
  by not having had the opportunity to convert yet.
