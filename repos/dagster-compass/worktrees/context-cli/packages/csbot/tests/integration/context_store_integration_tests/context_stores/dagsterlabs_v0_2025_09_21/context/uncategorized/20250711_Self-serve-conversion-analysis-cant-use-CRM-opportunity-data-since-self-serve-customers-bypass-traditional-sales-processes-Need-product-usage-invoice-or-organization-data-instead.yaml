topic: self-serve conversion analysis methodology
incorrect_understanding:
  Self-serve conversion rates can be analyzed using opportunity
  data from the CRM system, comparing self-serve vs enterprise opportunities
correct_understanding:
  Self-serve data is not represented in opportunity data. Self-serve
  customers typically bypass the traditional sales process and convert directly through
  the product, so analyzing self-serve conversion rates requires different data sources
  (like organizations, invoices, or product usage data) rather than CRM opportunity
  data
