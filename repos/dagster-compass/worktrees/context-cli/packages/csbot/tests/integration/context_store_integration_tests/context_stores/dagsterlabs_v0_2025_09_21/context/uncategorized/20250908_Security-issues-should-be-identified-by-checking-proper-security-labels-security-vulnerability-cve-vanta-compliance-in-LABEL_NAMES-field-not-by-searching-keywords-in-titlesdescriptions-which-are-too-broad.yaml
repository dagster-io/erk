topic: security issues identification
incorrect_understanding:
  Security issues should be identified by searching for keywords
  like "security", "vulnerability", or "cve" in issue titles and descriptions
correct_understanding:
  Security issues should be identified by checking for proper
  security labels in the LABEL_NAMES field. Keywords in titles/descriptions are too
  broad and catch non-security issues that just mention security in passing (like
  "security groups" or "security context"). The proper way is to check for labels
  like "security", "vulnerability", "cve", "vanta", "compliance", etc.
