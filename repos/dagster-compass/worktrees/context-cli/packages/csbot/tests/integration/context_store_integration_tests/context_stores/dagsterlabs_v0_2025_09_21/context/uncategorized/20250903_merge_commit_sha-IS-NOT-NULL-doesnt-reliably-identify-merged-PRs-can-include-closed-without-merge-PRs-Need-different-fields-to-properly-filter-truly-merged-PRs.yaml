topic: pull request merge vs close filtering
incorrect_understanding:
  when filtering for merged pull requests, using "merge_commit_sha
  IS NOT NULL" is sufficient to identify truly merged PRs vs those that were just
  closed
correct_understanding:
  merge_commit_sha IS NOT NULL can include PRs that were closed
  without merging. need to use a different field or combination of fields to properly
  identify only PRs that were actually merged into the target branch
search_keywords:
  pull request filtering, merge commit sha, merged vs closed, PR status,
  git merge detection, branch merging, repository queries, PR state validation
