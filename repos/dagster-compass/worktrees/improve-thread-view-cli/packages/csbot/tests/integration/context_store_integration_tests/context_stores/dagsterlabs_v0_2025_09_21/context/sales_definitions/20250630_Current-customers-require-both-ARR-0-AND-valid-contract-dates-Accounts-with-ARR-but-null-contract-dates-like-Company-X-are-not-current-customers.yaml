topic: current customer definition for manufacturing analysis
incorrect_understanding:
  I included Hasbro as a current customer because it had ARR
  value, but it has null values for first_contract_start_date and last_contract_end_date,
  which means it's not actually a current customer
correct_understanding:
  For current customers, I should filter for accounts that have
  both ARR > 0 AND valid contract dates (first_contract_start_date IS NOT NULL), not
  just ARR alone. Accounts with ARR but no contract dates are not current customers.
search_keywords:
  current customers, ARR, contract dates, first_contract_start_date,
  last_contract_end_date, customer definition, manufacturing analysis, Hasbro, null
  values, customer filtering
