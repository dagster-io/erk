topic: discovery to evaluation conversion analysis
incorrect_understanding:
  I incorrectly used STAGE_ORDER_NUMBER >= 4 and >= 5 to determine
  if opportunities reached discovery and evaluation stages, which only shows current
  stage position, not historical stage progression
correct_understanding:
  To properly analyze discovery to evaluation conversion, I need
  to use the specific stage date fields (DISCOVERY_DATE and EVALUATION_DATE) to determine
  which opportunities actually moved through these stages during their lifecycle,
  regardless of final outcome

  discovery to evaluation conversion, stage progression analysis, DISCOVERY_DATE,
  EVALUATION_DATE, STAGE_ORDER_NUMBER, sales funnel tracking, opportunity lifecycle,
  historical stage movement, conversion metrics, sales analytics
