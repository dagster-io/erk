topic: SAL definition and inbound/outbound categorization
incorrect_understanding:
  SAL means "sale" (closed won opportunities) and inbound/outbound
  categorization should be based on LEAD_SOURCE field with various categories
correct_understanding:
  SAL means opportunities with a SAL_DATE (Sales Accepted Lead
  date), not closed won deals. For inbound/outbound categorization, use RECENT_SOURCE
  field where 'Enterprise Contact Us' and 'Website Signup' are inbound, everything
  else is outbound
search_keywords:
  SAL, Sales Accepted Lead, SAL_DATE, RECENT_SOURCE, LEAD_SOURCE, inbound,
  outbound, Enterprise Contact Us, Website Signup, opportunity categorization, lead
  classification
