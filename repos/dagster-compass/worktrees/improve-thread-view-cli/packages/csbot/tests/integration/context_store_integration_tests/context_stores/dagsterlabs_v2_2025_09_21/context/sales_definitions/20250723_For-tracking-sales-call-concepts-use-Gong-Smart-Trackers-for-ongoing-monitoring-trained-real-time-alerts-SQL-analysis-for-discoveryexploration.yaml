topic: sales conversation analysis methodology and tool recommendations
incorrect_understanding:
  When users ask for detailed tracking of specific concepts,
  phrases, or themes in sales calls, I should focus primarily on providing SQL-based
  analysis and transcript searches
correct_understanding:
  "For detailed and accurate ongoing tracking of specific concepts
  in sales calls, I should recommend Gong Smart Trackers as the superior solution.
  My SQL analysis is best for discovery/exploratory analysis and historical deep dives.
  Smart Trackers offer: trained specificity on actual conversations, continuous learning
  from feedback, real-time alerts, and better context understanding. I should position
  my analysis as complementary for initial exploration, but direct users to Smart
  Trackers for ongoing monitoring and alerting."
