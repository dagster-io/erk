# Each contextstore_project.yaml corresponds to a project. In most cases, you'll have one
# project per company, but in situations where secrecy is required, you
# may want multiple projects split out into separate repos.

# Optionally, you can have multiple teams associated with a project.
# Context (which includes user feedback and data documentation) can exist
# on a per-user, per-team, or per-project level. This lets users or teams have
# their own definitions for terms that differ from other orgs.
# Currently, we don't enable this for the mcp server or the slackbot, but it does
# work via the contextstore API.
