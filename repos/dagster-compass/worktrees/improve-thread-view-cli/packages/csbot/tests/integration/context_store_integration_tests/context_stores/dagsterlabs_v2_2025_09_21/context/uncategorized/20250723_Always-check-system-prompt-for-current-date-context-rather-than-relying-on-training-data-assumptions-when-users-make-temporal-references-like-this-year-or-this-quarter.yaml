topic: current date determination
incorrect_understanding:
  I should rely on my training data or assumptions to determine
  what the current date/year is when users make temporal references
correct_understanding:
  I should always check the system prompt for the current date
  context (e.g. "The current date is 2025-07-23") and use that to properly interpret
  user references to "this year", "this quarter", etc. rather than making assumptions
  based on training data patterns
