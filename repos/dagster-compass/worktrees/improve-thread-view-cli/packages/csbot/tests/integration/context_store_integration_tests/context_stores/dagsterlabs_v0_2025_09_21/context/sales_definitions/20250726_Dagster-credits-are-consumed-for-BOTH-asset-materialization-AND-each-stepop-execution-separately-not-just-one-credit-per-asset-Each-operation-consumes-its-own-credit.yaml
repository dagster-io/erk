topic: dagster credits consumption model
incorrect_understanding: 1 asset materialization consumes 1 credit
correct_understanding:
  'Credits are consumed when either "an asset is materialized
  OR a step is run" - these are two different consumption events. An asset materialization
  AND each individual step/operation both consume credits separately. From the sales
  transcripts: "a credit is consumed any time an asset is materialized or a step is
  run" and "anytime an asset is materialized or an op is run, each of those consumes
  one credit"'
