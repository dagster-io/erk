incorrect_understanding:
  When analyzing pipeline, I should include all opportunities
  regardless of forecast category, including those marked as "Omitted"
correct_understanding:
  When analyzing pipeline, I should exclude opportunities with
  forecast category "Omitted" as these are not considered reliable for forecasting
  purposes. Pipeline analysis should only include forecast categories like Pipeline,
  BestCase, MostLikely, and Forecast.
