  include all active organizations regardless of payment status, which artificially
  deflates the metric due to free trial accounts
correct_understanding:
  When calculating weekly active organization rates, I should
  only include paying customers to get an accurate engagement metric. Free trial accounts
  artificially deflate this metric and should be excluded from the weekly active rate
