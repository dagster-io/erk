topic: closed won reasons analysis
incorrect_understanding:
  When asked about primary closed won reasons for enterprise
  opportunities, I analyzed the win_loss_competitor field which shows what competitors
  they beat, not why customers actually chose our platform
correct_understanding:
  For primary closed won reasons, I should analyze sales meeting
  transcripts using AI_AGG to extract actual customer motivations and pain points
  that drove the purchase decision. The win_loss_competitor field shows competitive
  displacement but not purchase drivers. Key themes include observability needs, orchestration
  challenges, migration from legacy tools, data quality requirements, and integration
  capabilities.
