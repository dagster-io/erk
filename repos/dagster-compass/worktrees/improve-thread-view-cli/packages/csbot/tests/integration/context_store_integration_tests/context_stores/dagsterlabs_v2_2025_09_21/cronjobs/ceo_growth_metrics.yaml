  "Create a comprehensive weekly growth metrics dashboard for executive leadership\
  \ including:\n\n1. New ARR by segment (corporate vs enterprise) with month-over-month\
  \ and quarter-over-quarter growth trends\n2. Customer acquisition cost (CAC) trends\
  \ by marketing channel and sales segment with payback period analysis  \n3. Trial-to-paid\
  \ conversion rates and average time-to-convert with cohort analysis\n4. Active organization\
  \ growth, seat expansion rates, and customer retention metrics\n5. Revenue per customer\
  \ trends and expansion revenue analysis\n6. Key growth lever performance (marketing\
  \ efficiency, sales productivity, product adoption)\n7. Create executive-level visualizations\
  \ with clear growth trajectory indicators\n8. Highlight key growth opportunities\
  \ and potential risks requiring leadership attention\n\nFocus on strategic insights\
  \ for executive decision-making around growth investments and resource allocation.\n\
  \nAdditional context: \nIMPORTANT FISCAL CALENDAR CONTEXT:\n- Company operates on\
  \ a fiscal year calendar where quarters are:\n  * FQ1: Feb-Apr  \n  * FQ2: May-Jul\n\
  \  * FQ3: Aug-Oct\n  * FQ4: Nov-Jan\n\nWhen analyzing quarterly performance and\
  \ growth trends, always use this fiscal calendar rather than calendar quarters.\
  \ This is critical for accurate QoQ comparisons and pacing analysis.\n\nFor Q3 analysis\
  \ specifically:\n- Q3 runs August 1 - October 31 (91 days)\n- Calculate percentage\
  \ completion based on current date vs August 1 start\n- Project full quarter performance\
  \ based on actual completion percentage\n- Compare to FQ2 performance (May-July)\
  \ for accurate QoQ trends\n- Historical quarters should be analyzed using this fiscal\
  \ calendar for consistency\n\nThis fiscal calendar context should be applied to\
  \ all quarterly ARR analysis, pipeline projections, and growth trend calculations\
  \ in future reports.\n\nAdditional context: CRITICAL UPDATE FOR WEEKLY ACTIVE RATE\
  \ CALCULATION: Weekly active organization rates should ONLY include paying customers,\
  \ not all active organizations. Free trial accounts artificially deflate this metric.\
  \ Filter the weekly active rate calculation to paying customers only to get accurate\
  \ engagement metrics. This is in addition to the previous update to remove all forecasting/projections."
