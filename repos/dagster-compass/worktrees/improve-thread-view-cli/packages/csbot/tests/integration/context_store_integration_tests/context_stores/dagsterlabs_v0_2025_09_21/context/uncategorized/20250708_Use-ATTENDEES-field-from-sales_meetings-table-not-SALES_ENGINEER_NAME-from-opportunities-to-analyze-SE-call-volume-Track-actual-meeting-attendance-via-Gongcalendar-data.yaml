correct_understanding:
  When analyzing sales engineer call volume, I should look at
  the actual meeting attendees in the ATTENDEES field from the sales_meetings table
  to see which SEs actually attended the meetings. The SALES_ENGINEER_NAME from opportunities
  shows account ownership, not meeting attendance. Sean Lopp cannot have attended
  meetings after December 2024, so I need to use actual attendee data from Gong/calendar
  systems.
