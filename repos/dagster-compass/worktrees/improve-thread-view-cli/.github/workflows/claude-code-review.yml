            **IMPORTANT: First read CLAUDE.md in the repository root for complete project guidance.**

            Review this pull request focusing ONLY on critical issues that are NOT caught by automated tooling:

            **FOCUS ON:**
            - Logic errors and potential bugs
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance issues or anti-patterns
            - Missing test coverage for critical paths
            - Architectural inconsistencies with existing codebase
            - Business logic correctness

            **DO NOT COMMENT ON:**
            - Type annotation style (enforced by pyright)
            - Code formatting (enforced by ruff/prettier)
            - Python 3.13+ compliance (enforced by pyright)
            - Import organization (enforced by ruff)
            - Docstring formatting (enforced by tooling)
            - Any style issues caught by automated checks

            **OUTPUT STYLE:**
            - Be extremely concise - maximum 2-3 bullet points total
            - For positive feedback, simply state what was checked (e.g., "✓ Reviewed error handling, security patterns, test coverage")
            - No praise or encouragement - focus on informational status
            - Only elaborate on actual issues found

            Only provide feedback if you identify genuine issues that could cause bugs, security problems, or architectural concerns.
