You can correct Compass if something in its answer is wrong or out of date.

To fix data context:

1. Ask your question in Slack.
2. When Compass replies, tell it what's wrong.
3. Compass updates its context so future answers are correct.

**Example:**

> **User**: "Who are our top sales reps by win rate?"
>
>
> **Compass:** Answers with a list of people including David Lee and Sarah Brown.
>
> **User:** "David Lee and Sarah Brown are not sales reps — please remove them."
>
> **Compass:** Updates the context.

## Data requests

When Compass can't answer a question, it will open a data request for your team automatically.

How it works:

1. Ask your question in Slack.
2. If Compass can't find the answer, it opens a request automatically.

**Example:**

> **User**: "Who were our top Git committers last week?"
>
>
> **Compass:** Compass tells you it can't find the answer  and opens a data request.
