Compass provisions a dedicated workspace for your organization and uses Slack Connect to create channels with your organization, so you can collaborate securely inside Slack. Admins control who can send, accept, or approve those invitations.

### Accept Slack Connect invite from email

> **⚠️ To connect Compass to your organization’s Slack, you’ll need permission to accept Slack Connect invitations. If you don’t have access, your Slack admin may need to complete this part of the onboarding process.**

- Check your email and accept the Slack Connect invite

## Troubleshooting Slack Connect Issues

### If you see “Unable to accept Slack Connect invitations”
This means your Slack account doesn’t have permission to approve Slack Connect requests. Don’t worry — the invite is still pending.

**Next step:** Ask a Slack Admin at your company to open Tools & settings → Manage Slack Connect Invitations → Open requests and approve the Compass invites.

Once they accept the invite, you'll be able to join the channel.
