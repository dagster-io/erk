Compass can instantly turn data into charts. Compass can create the following types of visualizations:

- 📊 bar charts
- 📈 line charts
- 🍩 donut charts
- ☁ word clouds

It can also customize with color, titles and axis labels, legends and grid lines and more.

To create a visualization:

1. Tell Compass exactly what type of chart you want and which data to use
2. Compass will render the chart for you.

**Example:**

> **User**: "Create a bar chart for me that shows win rate by week"
>
>
> **Compass:** Renders the visualization
>

## Create a recurring analysis

You can tell Compass to run the same analysis automatically on a schedule.

To schedule a recurring analysis:

1. Ask your question in Slack.
2. After Compass replies, say when you would like it to run (day and time).
3. Compass will confirm and create the recurring analysis.

**Example:**

> **User**: "How many support tickets were opened last week?"
>
>
> **Compass:** "We received 166 support tickets last week"
>
> **User:** "Please run this every Friday at 9am EST."
>

## Update or delete a recurring analysis

Need to tweak or remove a scheduled analysis? You can do it right from Slack.

To update:

1. Open the thread for the scheduled report.
2. Tell Compass what to change.

**Example:**

> **User**: "Can you update the analysis to show open and closed tickets, not just opened ones?"
>
>
> **Compass:** Updates the recurring analysis
>

To delete:

1. Open the thread.
2. Ask Compass to delete it.

**Example:**

> **User**: "Can you delete the analysis to show open and closed tickets, not just opened ones?"
>
>
> **Compass:** Deletes the recurring analysis
>
