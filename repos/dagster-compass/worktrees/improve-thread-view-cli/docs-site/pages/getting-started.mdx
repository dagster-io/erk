# Getting Started

## Quick start

In your Compass channel mention `@compass` and ask a question like:

- *"What data can you query?"*
- *"What are our top opportunities this quarter?"*
- *"I'm a sales leader, what data can you show me?"*
- *"I'm a product manager, how can this tool help me?"*

💬 **Tip:** You can reply directly in the same thread to ask Compass follow-up questions. Compass remembers the context so you can dig deeper without starting over.

## Collaborate in Compass

You can use Compass alongside your teammates in the same thread.

#### How it works:

1. Someone asks a question in Slack.
2. Another person can reply in the same thread with follow-ups.
